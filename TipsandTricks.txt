1. In case of string problems, convert it to char[] for better manipulation.

2. For cha[], try to use a boolean[] which by default contains "false" for every element. You can convert the characters into an int[] with
   the ASCII value of characters as index of the int[] for better manipulation.(See the first problem : isUnique)
